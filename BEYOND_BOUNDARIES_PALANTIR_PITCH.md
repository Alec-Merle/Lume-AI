## üéØ The Trillion-Dollar Problem Hidden in Plain Sight

Every Fortune 500 company sits on a goldmine of institutional knowledge‚Äîbut it's buried under decades of digital chaos. **Shared drives filled with "Final_v2_FINAL_USE_THIS.docx"** files. **Multiple versions of the same policy scattered across departments**. **Outdated contracts still being referenced in critical decisions**. **No single source of truth for anything**.

This isn't just an IT problem‚Äîit's an **existential business crisis** that prevents companies from leveraging the AI revolution that could transform their operations.

**Enter Lume: The missing bridge between enterprise document chaos and Palantir's world-class data intelligence platform.**
