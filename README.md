**Illuminated Archives for the Modern Enterprise**  
*AI-powered document vault with version control, approvals, and automated insights.*

## 🚀 Overview

LumReth is a next-generation document management system designed to help enterprises move beyond outdated file systems and fragmented collaboration tools.

Whether you’re in engineering, finance, legal, or program management, LumReth ensures every document is:
- **Organized intelligently**
- **Version-controlled**
- **Summarized by AI**
- **Governed with approvals**

## 🛠️ Architecture (MVP)

- **Frontend**: React (prototype deployable via Replit)  
- **Backend**: Node.js / FastAPI for API endpoints  
- **Storage**: Git backend for version control  
- **AI Layer**: LLM pipelines for classification + summaries  
- **Integration**: Palantir Foundry pipelines for data governance and enterprise scaling  

---

## 📈 Why LumReth?

Current enterprises suffer from:
- Bloated SharePoint drives  
- Confusing file hierarchies  
- Endless duplicate versions of Word/PDF docs  
- Approval processes hidden in email chains  

LumReth solves this by combining **developer-grade precision** (version control, diffs) with **business-friendly usability** (tiles, AI summaries, approvals).  

> Think *“Google Docs meets Git, with AI governance built in.”*
