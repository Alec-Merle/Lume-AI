# LumReth Business Plan  

> *"Illuminated Archives for the Modern Enterprise."*

## Executive Summary  

LumReth is an **AI-powered document management and governance platform** designed to modernize how enterprises handle documents, approvals, and compliance. Unlike traditional systems that leave teams buried in SharePoint folders, email chains, and outdated Word versions, LumReth automatically organizes, versions, and summarizes documents — providing a **single source of truth** for enterprise knowledge.  

The platform is built to bridge the gap between developer-style version control and business-friendly usability. By leveraging AI for intelligent organization and summaries, LumReth eliminates duplication, accelerates approvals, and ensures audit-ready compliance.
