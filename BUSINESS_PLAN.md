## Executive Summary  

LumReth is an **AI-powered document management and governance platform** designed to modernize how enterprises handle documents, approvals, and compliance.

The platform is built to bridge the gap between developer-style version control and business-friendly usability. By leveraging AI for intelligent organization and summaries, LumReth eliminates duplication, accelerates approvals, and ensures audit-ready compliance.
