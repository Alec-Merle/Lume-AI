## Problem Statement

### Market Pain Points

**Information Overload Crisis**
Modern enterprises generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, with 80% being unstructured documents. Organizations struggle with:
- Documents scattered across multiple systems and locations
- Inconsistent naming conventions and categorization
- Manual approval processes that create bottlenecks
- Lack of version control leading to confusion and errors
- Compliance challenges in regulated industries

**Current Solutions Fall Short**
Traditional document management systems are:
- **Reactive**: Requiring manual organization after the fact
- **Siloed**: Creating isolated repositories without cross-system intelligence
- **Rigid**: Forcing users into predefined structures that don't match workflows
- **Compliance-Weak**: Lacking comprehensive audit trails and governance features

**Quantified Impact**
Research indicates that knowledge workers spend:
- 2.5 hours daily searching for information
- 30% of their time on manual document tasks
- $15,000 annually per employee on document-related inefficiencies
